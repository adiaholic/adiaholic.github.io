Rust&amp;rsquo;s memory safety features, such as ownership and borrowing, minimize the risk of bugs and crashes, crucial for a robust OCR application. Additionally, Rust&amp;rsquo;s ability to interact with C/C++ libraries seamlessly provides access to efficient image processing libraries, enhancing performance.</description>
